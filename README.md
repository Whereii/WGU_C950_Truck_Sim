# WGU_C950_Truck_Sim
<h1>WGU C950 Truck Simulator</h1>
<p>This project was created to complete the C950 class at WGU. The goal of the whole project was to take in provided packages
and provided destinations with their distances and create a program that would deliver the packages using a set of prerequisite principles.
</p>
<h2>Running the Program</h2>
<p>To run the program you need to clone the whole repositor and then compile the program using the main.py file as your root or target such as "python3 main.py". Then you should be able to follow the included input instructions in the program. Be sure that you provide input exactly as instructed because this program does not include error checking.</p>
